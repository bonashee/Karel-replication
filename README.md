# Karel-replication

Karel is an educational programming language for beginners. A program in Karel is used to control a simple robot named Karel that lives in an environment consisting of a grid of streets (left-right) and avenues (up-down). Karel understands just five basic instructions. A programmer can create additional instructions by defining them in terms of the five basic instructions, and by using conditional control flow statements if and while with environment queries, and by using the iterate construct ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_(programming_language))).

I replicated the Karel programming language as my final project for the Stanford University course "Code In Place". The replication was made using Tkinter library and it includes Karel world editing, all functions, and error messages.

Video examples of Karel replication code you can find [here](https://youtu.be/8VrtzXt4mPs) and [here](https://youtu.be/CadaeahQthc). The project page on the Stanford University website is [here](https://compedu.stanford.edu/codeinplace/public/projects/0468.html).
